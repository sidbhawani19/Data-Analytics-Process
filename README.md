<h1>Data Analytics in Everyday Life</h1>

<p>
  We often use Data Analytics in our daily routines without even realizing it. Let's explore a simple scenario: going to the market to buy something.
</p>

<h2>Data Analytics Process Applied to Shopping</h2>

<h3>1. Plan</h3>
<p>Before heading to the market, we decide what items we need - shirts, jeans, footwear, etc.</p>

<h3>2. Prepare</h3>
<p>We assess how much we are willing to spend and plan how to acquire the necessary funds for the shopping trip.</p>

<h3>3. Process</h3>
<p>We identify specific preferences from the available data. For example, if we're shopping for footwear, we decide whether we want slippers, shoes, sandals, etc.</p>

<h3>4. Analyze</h3>
<p>We consider trends and analyze whether the chosen items fit our existing wardrobe. We evaluate color combinations and ensure our choices align with fashion trends.</p>

<h3>5. Share</h3>
<p>We communicate our preferences and requirements to the shopkeeper, seeking advice on the best-suited items based on our analytics.</p>

<h3>6. Act</h3>
<p>Finally, we make the purchase based on the insights gathered throughout the data analytics process.</p>

<p>This example demonstrates how we subconsciously apply data analytics in various aspects of our daily lives without explicitly recognizing it. Similarly, my task was to give the example(s) of such a real-life situation where we use Data Analytics and link it with the data analytics process.</p>
